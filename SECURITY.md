| `Pre-release` | ðŸš«                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a vulnerability in this repository, please follow the steps below:

1. **Do not open a public issue.**
   - To protect the integrity of the project and its users, refrain from disclosing vulnerabilities in public forums.

2. **Contact us privately via email:**
   - Email: `5orc3.dev@gmail.com`
   - Use PGP encryption for sensitive information. Our PGP public key can be found in `SECURITY.md.gpg` (provided in the repository).

3. **Provide the following details:**
   - A clear and concise description of the vulnerability.
   - Steps to reproduce the issue.
   - Potential impact of the vulnerability.
   - Any suggested fixes or patches (if applicable).

We aim to acknowledge your report within **48 hours** and provide a detailed response within **7 days**. We will work with you to validate and address the vulnerability promptly.

## Security Best Practices for Contributors

To maintain the security and integrity of the project, contributors are encouraged to follow these guidelines:

1. **Code Reviews:**
   - All contributions must go through code review to identify potential security flaws.
   - Use secure coding practices, especially when dealing with cryptography, networking, and blockchain features.

2. **Dependencies:**
   - Avoid introducing dependencies with known vulnerabilities.
   - Regularly update dependencies to their latest secure versions.

3. **Authentication & Authorization:**
   - Ensure proper mechanisms are implemented for validating peer identities, voting, and multi-agent interactions.

4. **Encryption Standards:**
   - Use state-of-the-art encryption for data in transit and at rest.
   - Avoid hardcoding sensitive credentials or secrets.

## Key Areas of Concern

This project integrates advanced technologies such as peer-to-peer networking, federated learning, and blockchain. Special attention should be given to the following:

1. **Peer-to-Peer Networking:**
   - Protect against Sybil attacks and malicious peer behavior.
   - Ensure the Distributed Hash Table (DHT) implementation is resistant to poisoning.

2. **Federated Learning:**
   - Safeguard model updates against adversarial attacks (e.g., model poisoning).
   - Implement differential privacy where applicable to protect user data.

3. **Blockchain and Tokenomics:**
   - Validate smart contracts rigorously to prevent exploits.
   - Secure consensus mechanisms for proof-of-stake voting to mitigate vulnerabilities.

4. **Reputation-Based Tier System:**
   - Ensure the integrity of the reputation system to prevent manipulation or gaming by malicious actors.

5. **Multi-Agent Systems:**
   - Design agent interactions to prevent unauthorized behavior and ensure accountability.

## Disclosure Policy

We follow a **responsible disclosure** policy. 
- Vulnerabilities will be disclosed publicly after a fix is implemented and released.
- Credit will be given to those who report vulnerabilities responsibly.

Let us work together to ensure the security and robustness of this framework for AGI development.
