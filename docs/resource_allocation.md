# Resource Allocation and Fairness

## Overview

The vAIn network implements a fair resource allocation system that ensures:
- Balanced workload distribution
- Fair reward distribution based on contributions
- Dynamic rebalancing of resources

## Resource Metrics

Resources are weighted as follows:
- Compute Power (GFLOPS): 40%
- Storage (GB): 30%
- Bandwidth (Mbps): 30%

## Load Balancing

The system automatically rebalances workloads when:
- Node utilization exceeds fair share by 20%
- New nodes join the network
- Existing nodes update their resource availability

## Reward Structure

Rewards are calculated using:
1. Base staking rewards
2. Resource contribution multiplier
3. Time commitment bonuses
4. Node reliability metrics

## Anti-Gaming Measures

The system implements several measures to prevent gaming:
- Resource verification through proof-of-work
- Periodic resource audits
- Slashing penalties for false reporting
- Rolling average calculations for stability
