# Scalability Features

## Network Optimization

### Hierarchical Aggregation
- Local clusters of 10 nodes perform first-level aggregation
- Cluster results are aggregated at regional level
- Reduces network traffic and improves scalability
- O(log n) communication complexity vs O(n) in flat networks

### Adaptive Compression
- Dynamic compression using exponential decay
- Reinforcement learning optimization
- Quality-aware rate adjustment
- Performance-based reward system

### Dynamic Clustering
- Automatic cluster size adjustment
- Latency-based node grouping
- Multi-level hierarchy management
- K-means based cluster optimization

### Resource Management
- Dynamic rebalancing thresholds
- Reputation decay system
- Task queuing mechanism
- Anomaly detection for gaming prevention
- Load-based threshold adjustment

### Congestion Control
- Adaptive rate limiting per node
- Window-based flow control
- Automatic backoff during high congestion
- Fair bandwidth allocation across nodes

## Performance Considerations
- Local aggregation reduces central server load
- Sparse gradient updates minimize network traffic
- Automatic compression adjustment based on network quality
- Graceful degradation under heavy load

## Performance Monitoring
- Network latency tracking
- Cluster efficiency metrics
- Resource utilization analysis
- Gaming attempt detection
