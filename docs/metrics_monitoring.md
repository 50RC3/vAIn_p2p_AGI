# Metrics & Monitoring System

## Overview

The vAIn network implements comprehensive metrics collection and monitoring to ensure optimal performance, detect anomalies, and provide insights for system optimization.

## Resource Metrics

### System Metrics
The system tracks the following resource metrics in real-time:

| Metric | Description | Typical Range |
|--------|-------------|---------------|
| CPU Usage | Processing utilization percentage | 0-100% |
| Memory Usage | RAM utilization percentage | 0-100% |
| Disk Usage | Storage utilization percentage | 0-100% |
| Network I/O | Bandwidth usage (sent/received) | Variable |
| GPU Usage | GPU utilization when available | 0-100% |
| Latency | Response time in milliseconds | 5-500ms |
| Error Count | Number of errors in time period | Variable |

### Training Metrics
During model training, additional metrics are collected:

- Model convergence rate
- Average validation time
- Training accuracy
- Loss values
- Gradient statistics
- Update deviation
- Byzantine detection metrics

## Monitoring Systems

### NetworkMonitor

Tracks overall network health with metrics including:
- Peer count
- Connection success rate
- Average latency
- Bandwidth usage
- Overall health score (0-100)

```python
# Typical usage:
network_monitor = NetworkMonitor(metrics_dir=Path("./metrics"))
health_metrics = await network_monitor.get_health_metrics()
await network_monitor.save_metrics(health_metrics)
```

### ResourceMonitor

Monitors system resource utilization with:
- Real-time CPU, memory, and disk tracking
- GPU utilization where available
- Configurable check intervals
- Interactive resource checking

```python
# Typical usage:
resource_monitor = ResourceMonitor(check_interval=60)
metrics = resource_monitor.get_current_metrics()
resource_monitor.start_tracking()
```

### MetricsCollector

Centralized metrics collection system that:
- Aggregates metrics from multiple sources
- Creates historical snapshots
- Provides statistical analysis
- Tracks performance over time
- Supports interactive metrics viewing

## Storage and Analysis

Metrics are stored in various formats:
- JSON files for persistence
- Time-series data for trending
- Aggregated summaries for reporting
- Event-triggered metrics for anomaly detection

Example metrics JSON format:
```json
{
  "timestamp": 1643726482,
  "peer_count": 42,
  "connection_success_rate": 0.95,
  "avg_latency": 78.3,
  "bandwidth_usage": 1.24,
  "overall_health": 87.5
}
```

## Alert System

The monitoring system generates alerts when:
- CPU usage exceeds 95% (warning at 85%)
- Memory usage exceeds 95% (warning at 85%)
- Disk usage exceeds 95% (warning at 85%)
- Error rates spike above historical baseline
- Connection success rate falls below 80%
- Node becomes unresponsive for >60 seconds

## Dashboard Integration

- REST API endpoints
- WebSocket real-time streaming
