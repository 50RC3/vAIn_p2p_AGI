# vAIn Architecture - Implementation Notes

## Current State

As the sole developer of vAIn, I'm building a decentralized AI training platform that combines federated learning with blockchain technology. Here's my current progress:

### Core Components (v0.2.1)

1. Federated Learning System (30% Complete)
   - Basic model distribution ✓
   - Local training implementation ✓
   - Simple aggregation protocol ✓
   - Initial compression (10-20% rates) ✓
   - TODO: Advanced training features
   - TODO: Efficient model updates
   - TODO: Better compression algorithms

2. Blockchain Layer (40% Complete)
   - Basic smart contracts ✓
   - Simple staking mechanism ✓
   - Basic reputation tracking ✓
   - TODO: Advanced governance
   - TODO: Enhanced reputation system
   - TODO: Complex economic model

3. Network Layer (55% Complete)
   - Basic peer discovery ✓
   - Simple DHT routing ✓
   - Basic encryption ✓
   - TODO: Advanced P2P features
   - TODO: Better consensus
   - TODO: Byzantine fault tolerance

### Interactive Features (v0.1.3)

Current implementation status:
- NONE & MINIMAL modes: Working ✓
- NORMAL mode: Partially implemented
- VERBOSE mode: Early development

Safety features status:
- Basic timeouts ✓
- Simple validation ✓
- Basic error recovery ✓
- TODO: Advanced monitoring
- TODO: Graceful interruption
- TODO: Automated recovery

Note: This is my active development project. Features marked with ✓ are implemented and tested, though many need further optimization. Others are in various stages of development.
