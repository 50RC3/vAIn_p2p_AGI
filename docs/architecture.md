# vAIn Architecture - Implementation Notes

## Current State

As the sole developer of vAIn, I'm building a decentralized AI training platform that combines federated learning with blockchain technology. Here's my current progress:

   - TODO: Efficient model updates
   - TODO: Better compression algorithms

2. Blockchain Layer (40% Complete)
   - Basic smart contracts ✓
   - Basic stake-based validation ✓
   - Simple reputation scoring ✓
   - Three-tier node system ✓
   - Basic voting mechanism ✓
   - TODO: Hardware attestation
   - TODO: Advanced fraud prevention
   - TODO: Zero-knowledge proofs
   - TODO: Enhanced governance
   - TODO: Complex economic model

3. Network Layer (55% Complete)
   - Basic peer discovery ✓
   - Simple DHT routing ✓
   - Basic encryption ✓
   - TODO: Advanced P2P features
   - TODO: Better consensus
   - TODO: Byzantine fault tolerance

4. Network Communication (65% Complete)
   - Basic P2P discovery ✓
   - DHT routing ✓
   - Basic encryption ✓
   - Pheromone propagation system ✓
     - Resource discovery
     - Route optimization
     - Task coordination
   - TODO: Advanced P2P features
   - TODO: Better consensus
   - TODO: Byzantine fault tolerance

5. Storage Layer (75% Complete)
   - IPFS integration ✓
     - Distributed model storage
     - Metadata persistence
     - Pheromone data storage
   - Content addressing ✓
   - Automatic garbage collection ✓
   - TODO: Advanced caching
   - TODO: Pinning strategies
   - TODO: Replication management

### Interactive Features (v0.1.3)

Current implementation status:
- NONE & MINIMAL modes: Working ✓
- NORMAL mode: Partially implemented
- VERBOSE mode: Early development

Safety features status:
- Basic timeouts ✓
- Simple validation ✓
- Basic error recovery ✓
- TODO: Advanced monitoring
- TODO: Graceful interruption
- TODO: Automated recovery

Note: This is my active development project. Features marked with ✓ are implemented and tested, though many need further optimization. Others are in various stages of development.
