### Decentralized P2P AGI Network - ***Full System Outline***

[![Python Code Quality Checks (vAIn_p2p_AGI)](https://github.com/50RC3/vAIn_p2p_AGI/actions/workflows/pylint.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/50RC3/vAIn_p2p_AGI/actions/workflows/pylint.yml)

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the decentralized peer-to-peer (P2P) AGI network, detailing its architecture, functionality, and key features. It is intended to guide developers, contributors, and stakeholders in understanding the system's design, governance, and implementation.

##### 1. Network Type
- **Peer-to-Peer (P2P) decentralized topology**:
  - No central authority; governance and decisions are distributed.
  - Nodes communicate directly through a mix of UDP broadcasting and DHT (Distributed Hash Table).
  - Self-organizing structure, where nodes discover peers and form a dynamic, reputation-based hierarchy.

#### Security
- **Production Security**:
  - TLS 1.3+ encryption for all node communications
  - Rate limiting and DoS protection
  - Automatic malicious node detection and blacklisting
  - Multi-region failover support
    - Automatic malicious node detection and blacklisting
    - Multi-region failover support

##### 2. Node Structure
- **Nodes contribute computational resources, storage, and bandwidth**:
  - Resource verification using hardware attestation
- **Each node has an identity** (public-private key pair) used for authentication:
  - ED25519 keypairs for optimal security/performance
  - Hierarchical deterministic key generation
  - Automatic key rotation every 90 days
  - Hardware security module (HSM) support
  - **Example**: When a node joins the network, it uses its private key to sign a message proving its identity. Other nodes verify the signature using the node's public key, ensuring secure and authenticated communication.
  - Automatic key rotation every 90 days
  - Hardware security module (HSM) support
- **Nodes are tiered based on reputation and contributions**:
  - Configurable tier thresholds and requirements
  - Byzantine fault tolerance up to f=(n-1)/3 malicious nodes (ensures the system can function correctly even if up to one-third of the nodes act maliciously; see [Byzantine Fault Tolerance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault_tolerance) for more details)
  - Byzantine fault tolerance up to f=(n-1)/3 malicious nodes
  - Proof-of-stake weighted voting rights

#### Peer Discovery & Network Connectivity

##### 1. Peer Discovery
- **UDP Broadcasting** for local network discovery.
- **DHT (Distributed Hash Table)** for scalable, distributed lookups.
- **Node Announcement Protocol**: New nodes send out identity packets to introduce themselves.
- **PEX (Peer Exchange)**: Allows nodes to share known peer information with each other, enhancing discovery.
- **Hierarchical Node Announcements**: High-reputation nodes act as relays to announce new nodes, improving the efficiency and reliability of peer discovery.

##### 2. Secure Connection & Handshake
- **Public Key Cryptography (RSA/ECDSA)** for identity verification.
- **Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH)** for encrypted key exchange.
- **Digital Signatures** to verify message authenticity.

#### Reputation & Tier System

##### 1. Reputation Scoring
- Reputation is based on:
  - Resource contribution (CPU, storage, bandwidth).
  - Task completion & uptime.
  - Manual audits and peer feedback.
  - Voting participation in governance.
  - **Social Graph Analysis**: Nodes' interactions and relationships are analyzed to enhance reputation scoring.
- Nodes earn reputation over time and can be penalized for malicious actions.

##### 2. Tiered Node System
- **Initiate Cluster (Level 1)**: New nodes, monitored for reliability.
- **Higher Tiers (Level 2, Level 3, etc.)**: Earned through reputation growth.
  - Higher-tier nodes have:
    - Increased voting power.
    - Higher task priority.
    - Ability to audit lower-tier nodes.
    - **Relay Role**: High-reputation nodes can act as relays for new node announcements.

#### Resource Contribution & Task Allocation

##### 1. Decentralized Resource Sharing
- Nodes voluntarily contribute computational power and storage.
- Weighted allocation: Higher-tier nodes get priority for computing tasks.
- Load balancing: Ensures fair distribution of workloads.

##### 2. Task Assignment Protocol
- **Federated Learning Coordination**: Assigns AI training tasks to multiple nodes.
- **Adaptive Task Scheduling**: Dynamically adjusts tasks based on available resources.
- **Proof-of-Work Mechanism** for verifying computational contributions.

#### Federated Learning & AGI Model Training

##### 1. Model Training Process
- **Federated Learning (FL) Protocol**:
  - Nodes train local AI models with assigned data.
  - Gradient updates are shared, not raw data (privacy-preserving).
  - A central aggregation function (within the decentralized protocol) combines updates.
  - **Compression and Delta Updates**: Optimize communication by compressing model updates and sharing only the differences (deltas) from the last update.
  - **Multi-Agent System**: Each agent has its own instance of the Hybrid Memory System for local updates and meta-learning.

##### 2. Security in AI Training
- **Encrypted Model Updates**: Prevents data leaks during training.
- **Differential Privacy**: Ensures nodes don’t extract sensitive training data.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Flags poisoned or malicious updates.

#### Governance & Decision-Making

##### 1. Voting System
- Decisions on upgrades, policies, and audits are made democratically.
- **Voting Power = Node Tier Level**:
  - Tier 1 = 1 vote.
  - Tier 2 = 2 votes.
  - Tier 3 = 3 votes.
- Majority rules, but higher-tier votes have greater influence.

##### 2. Manual Audits
- Nodes can request an audit of others.
- **Audit teams (higher-tier nodes)** review and verify contributions.
- Successful audits increase reputation; failed audits penalize nodes.

#### Network Security & Fraud Prevention

##### 1. Malicious Node Detection
- **Behavior analysis**: Detects anomalies in contributions and interactions.
- **Threshold-based reputation penalties**:
  - Dropping below a reputation threshold results in temporary suspension.
  - Repeated violations lead to permanent bans.

##### 2. Cryptographic Security
- **End-to-End Encryption (E2EE)**: All messages are securely encrypted.
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP)**: Enables identity verification without revealing private data.

#### Failure Recovery & Network Maintenance

##### 1. Fault-Tolerance
- **Auto-redundancy**: Key data is replicated across multiple nodes.
- **Graceful Degradation**: The network self-heals by reallocating resources when nodes fail.

##### 2. Network Health Monitoring
- **Heartbeats & Liveness Probes**: Ensure active participation.
- **Stale Node Cleanup**: Removes inactive nodes automatically.
