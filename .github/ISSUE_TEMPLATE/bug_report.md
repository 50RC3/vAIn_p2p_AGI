**Describe the Bug**
*(Provide a clear and concise description of what the bug is. What component or module seems affected? E.g., "Model inference fails under condition X", "P2P node synchronization stalls after Y hours")*

**To Reproduce**
*(Detail the precise steps needed to reliably reproduce the behavior. Include specific configurations, data inputs, or model states.)*
1. Configure system with parameters: `...`
2. Load dataset/model: `...` (Specify version/source if applicable)
3. Run command / interact with API endpoint: `...`
4. Trigger condition: `...` (e.g., specific input, network event, time duration)
5. Observe error: `...` (Include full error messages or stack traces if possible)

**Expected Behavior**
*(Describe what you expected to happen when following the steps above. E.g., "Model should return inference results within 500ms", "Nodes should successfully synchronize state")*

**Actual Behavior**
*(Describe what actually happened. Include error messages, logs, or unexpected outputs.)*

**Screenshots & Logs**
*(If applicable, add screenshots, code snippets, or **relevant log excerpts** to help explain the problem. For performance issues, include relevant metrics.)*
